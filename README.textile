This is just a spike. Please do not use.

This is mostly an experiment to see how low-memory I can make a simple process launcher/watcher.

Goals:
* No dependencies other than Ruby
* Extremely low memory consumption
* Simple DSL

TODO:
* Everything

Current status:
* Pros
** Uses under 2MB of RAM on Ruby 1.8.7
* Cons
** Only supports watching single processes for life
** No support for any other kinds of watches
** In other words... this is not even alpha quality
** So don't use it.
